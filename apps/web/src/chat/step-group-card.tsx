/**
 * A run of tool calls, as one card.
 *
 * The transcript used to draw twenty mono lines for a turn that read twenty files, which is a
 * wall the eye slides off — and the two lines that mattered, the failure and the file that
 * changed, were somewhere in the middle of it. So the run collapses to a single face: what it is
 * doing now while it is going, and how much it did once it has stopped.
 *
 * `<details>` again, so the disclosure semantics, the keyboard handling and the `aria-expanded`
 * nobody has to remember to update all come from the platform.
 *
 * **A group containing a failure opens itself.** That is the rule the individual steps already
 * followed, lifted to the group: everything else is one click away, but a failure the reader has
 * to go looking for is a failure they will miss.
