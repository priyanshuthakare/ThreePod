 * One thing the agent did, as a row inside the group's card.
 *
 * A step is a single line by default: an icon for the kind of work, a verb, the one argument that
 * identifies it, and how it ended. `<details>` does the collapsing, which means the keyboard
 * support and the disclosure semantics come from the platform rather than from a click handler
 * and an `aria-expanded` someone has to remember to update.
 *
 * A failed step opens itself. Everything else is one click away, but a failure the reader has to
 * go looking for is a failure they will miss.
 *
 * **Status is in the summary as words.** Colour and the icon say the same thing faster for people
 * who can see them, and nothing at all for people who cannot.
