/**
 * What the agent is doing right now, said in a sentence.
 *
 * A turn is bursts of tool calls separated by silences of ten or twenty seconds, and during a
 * silence the transcript is a static list of things that already finished. So the running
 * indicator carries a label, and the label is derived from the same fold everything else on the
 * rail is drawn from — there is no second source of truth about what is happening, because a
 * second one would eventually disagree with the steps printed directly above it.
 *
 * Pure, and in a `.ts` beside `transcript.ts` for the same reason that one is: the interesting
 * cases are parallel calls and a log that begins mid-turn, and neither needs a DOM to test.
