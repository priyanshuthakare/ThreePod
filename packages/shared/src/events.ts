/**
 * The event contract.
 *
 * `events` is the most load-bearing table in Nap — chat transcript, agent audit log,
 * WebSocket replay source, and v2's memory substrate, all one table (docs/PLAN.md §5).
 * Every producer and consumer validates against this union, so the shape is defined
 * exactly once here.
 *
 * Two rules govern the shapes below, both of them about surviving Postgres `jsonb`:
 *
 *   - **No `Date`, no `undefined`.** Timestamps are ISO-8601 strings and absent values are
 *     `null`. An event must satisfy `parse(JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(e)))` deep-equals `e`,
 *     and neither a `Date` nor a dropped `undefined` key does.
 *   - **Payloads are strict.** An unknown key is a bug in the producer, not something to
 *     silently drop on the way into the log.
 *
 * `sessionId` and `turnId` are UUIDs, matching the `uuid` primary keys the database schema
 * uses. Validating the format here means a malformed id is caught at the boundary rather
 * than by Postgres several layers later.
