 * the exclusive-externals rule has to live: a third-party package with one owner is a fact
 * about what gets installed. `checkSourceImports` reads the specifiers the source actually
 * imports, because a manifest is a declaration and the import is the edge — Bun hoists
 * workspace packages into one root `node_modules`, so an import of a package this one never
 * declared resolves and typechecks, and the production image is built by one workspace-wide
 * install over the whole repo, so it ships too.
